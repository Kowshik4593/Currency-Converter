Currency Converter

This Java-based Currency Converter application provides an intuitive interface for converting amounts between various international currencies. The application is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and follows a modular design with distinct components for different functionalities.
Key Features:

    User Authentication: A login screen with validation for username and password, including options for sign-up and reset functionalities.
    Currency Conversion: Users can select from a range of currencies including Indian Rupee, US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and more, and convert amounts between the selected currencies.
    Real-time Conversion: Conversion rates are predefined within the application, and the conversion results are displayed instantly upon input.
    Reset Functionality: Users can reset the selected currencies and entered amounts to their default states with a single click.
    Next Screen Navigation: A "Next" button allows users to navigate to additional functionality or forms, although this is placeholder behavior in the current implementation.
    Show/Hide Password: The login form includes an option to toggle the visibility of the password field for better user experience.

Technical Details:

    GUI Framework: Java Swing
    Design Pattern: Modular design separating login functionality from currency conversion
    Error Handling: Basic input validation with error messages for invalid inputs
    UI Components: Custom labels, buttons, text fields, and combo boxes styled with a consistent font and layout using GridBagLayout and null layout for precise positioning.

This project is ideal for understanding the basics of Java Swing applications, user authentication, and performing simple arithmetic operations based on user input.
